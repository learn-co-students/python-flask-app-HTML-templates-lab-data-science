We'll use HTML to help us make our web page look a bit more organized and stylized. Then we'll go a step further and create templates for our HTML pages. This will help make our program more reusable and flow a bit cleaner by separating our concerns. This will become clearer as we start building, so let's get started! "

If we change our route from `\"/profile/mary\"` to `\"/profile/<name>\"` and we have our method underneath this route take an argument of `name`, which is being passed by our route, we can make it this route a lot more dynamic.
